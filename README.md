# Information

- The start of the accession process consists of sending a form through the channel, following the format specified therein.

- Regardless of whether you are accepted or rejected, you will be notified through the thread of the same request within a maximum period of 7 days.
If the server you have submitted does not meet the minimum requirements for servers that are specified in the Rules (#rules), the application will not be accepted. We want to accept most servers, but they must meet some strict, yet easy to follow conditions.

- When you are accepted, you must create a channel called guild-confederation on your server, and add the partnerships channel updates on the main confederation server. This is the only subsequent requirement that the server must meet, and failure to comply will result in the server's immediate expulsion from the Confederation. We take very seriously the collaboration of all members of this organization.

- If a server is under attack, the entire Confederation is under attack, and it and its members will ensure its protection.

- As benefits, the Confederation offers top quality configuration, protection and security measures, community resources and programming help to all its members.
